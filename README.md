## TL;DR — Host a Game in 5 Minutes

> You only need to do the **First-Time Setup** once. After that, hosting is just two commands.

```bash
# First time only:
#   1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org (LTS version)
#   2. Then run:
git clone https://github.com/dmytrobondarenko-cloud/ice-breaker-games.git
cd ice-breaker-games
npm install

# Every time you want to play:
npm start                        # starts the game server

# To let friends join over the internet, open a SECOND terminal:
npx localtunnel --port 3000      # gives you a public URL to share
```

Send the URL to your friends. They open it in their browser — nothing to install on their end. One person clicks **Host Room**, shares the 4-character room code, everyone else clicks **Join Room**.

---

## First-Time Setup (Detailed)

You only need to do this once on the computer that will run the server.

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Node.js is the engine that runs the game server.

**macOS:**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the **LTS** version (the big green button)
3. Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installer
4. Open **Terminal** (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", hit Enter) and verify:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   You should see version numbers (e.g. `v20.11.0` and `10.2.0`). If you do, Node.js is installed.

**Windows:**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the **LTS** version
3. Run the `.msi` installer — accept all defaults, make sure "Add to PATH" is checked
4. Open **PowerShell** (press `Win + X`, click "PowerShell") and verify:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

### Step 2: Install Git

**macOS:**
- Open Terminal and run `git --version`
- If not installed, macOS will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools — click **Install** and wait

**Windows:**
- Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Run the installer with default settings

### Step 3: Download the Game

Open Terminal (macOS) or PowerShell (Windows) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmytrobondarenko-cloud/ice-breaker-games.git
cd ice-breaker-games
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This takes about 10–30 seconds. You only need to do this once.

**You're done with setup.** Continue to one of the hosting guides below.

## Hosting for Friends Over the Internet

This is the most common scenario: you want to play with friends who are NOT on the same Wi-Fi. You'll run the server on your computer, then use a free tunnel to make it accessible from anywhere.

### What you'll need

- The computer running the server (yours)
- Two terminal windows open on your computer
- Your friends just need a browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox — any device)

### Step-by-step

**Terminal 1 — Start the game server:**

```bash
cd ice-breaker-games
npm start
```

You'll see:
```
Game server running on http://localhost:3000
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to play.
```

Leave this terminal running. **Do not close it** — it's your game server.

**Terminal 2 — Create a public link:**

Open a second terminal window and run one of these (pick whichever works for you):

**Option A — localtunnel (easiest, no signup):**
```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```
You'll see something like:
```
your url is: https://ugly-fish-42.loca.lt
```

**Option B — ngrok (most reliable, free signup required):**
1. Create a free account at https://ngrok.com
2. Download and install ngrok from the dashboard
3. Authenticate (one time only):
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
   ```
4. Start the tunnel:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
   You'll see a screen with:
   ```
   Forwarding    https://ab12-34-56-78-90.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:3000
   ```
   The `https://...ngrok-free.app` URL is what you share.

**Option C — Cloudflare Tunnel (no signup, reliable):**
1. Install cloudflared: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/
2. Run:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Look for the `*.trycloudflare.com` URL in the output.

### Share the link and play

1. **Copy the public URL** from your tunnel (e.g., `https://ugly-fish-42.loca.lt`)
2. **Send it to your friends** via text, Slack, Discord, email — whatever you use
3. Friends open the URL in their browser. They'll see the Game Arena lobby.
4. **You** (the host) also open the same URL in your browser
5. Enter your name and click **Host Room**
6. You'll see a 4-character room code like `AB12`
7. **Tell your friends the room code** — they enter it and click **Join Room**
8. Once everyone's in (up to 6 players), click **Start Games**
9. Everyone votes on which game to play (30-second timer). The most-voted game starts automatically.
10. The host clicks **End Game** when ready to move on — voting starts again for the next game.

### Important notes

- **Keep both terminals open** while playing. Closing either one stops the game.
- **The URL changes** every time you restart the tunnel. You'll need to share a new link next session.
- **Players don't install anything.** They just click the link and play in their browser.
- **You should also use the tunnel URL** (not `localhost:3000`) to play, so you're on the same connection as your friends.

---

## Hosting on the Same Wi-Fi (LAN)

If everyone is in the same room or on the same Wi-Fi network, you don't need a tunnel.

### 1. Start the server

```bash
cd ice-breaker-games
npm start
```

### 2. Find your local IP address

**macOS:**
```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
ipconfig | findstr /i "IPv4"
```

This gives you something like `192.168.1.42`.

### 3. Everyone opens the game

Tell your friends to open their browser and go to:

```
http://192.168.1.42:3000
```

(Replace with your actual IP.)

### 4. Host and play

- You click **Host Room** and share the 4-character code
- Friends enter the code and click **Join Room**
- Click **Start Games** when everyone's in

---

## Playing Solo (Testing / Local)

Just to try the game on your own machine:

```bash
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. You can open multiple tabs to simulate multiple players.

---

## Development Mode

For developers making changes to the code (with hot-reload):

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Game server
npm run server

# Terminal 2 — Vite dev server with hot-reload
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. The frontend auto-connects to the game server on port 3000. Changes to `src/` files reload instantly.

## Game Controls

| Game | Controls |
|------|----------|
| **Snake Arena** | Arrow keys or WASD to move |
| **Two Truths & a Lie** | Type statements / Click to vote |
| **Emoji Storytelling** | Type emojis / Type guesses |
| **Sketch & Guess** | Draw with mouse or trackpad / Type guesses |
| **Speed Trivia** | Click an answer option |

**Host controls:**
- **Start Games** — begins the first voting round from the lobby
- **End Game** — ends the current game, awards a game win to the leading player, and returns to voting
- **Next Round** (Snake only) — starts a new snake round after one ends

**Leaderboards:**
- **Rounds Won** — tracked within each game session. Each round has a winner (e.g., last snake alive, first correct guesser, top trivia scorer). Shown in the in-game scoreboard.
- **Games Won** — tracked across all game sessions. When the host clicks End Game, the player with the most rounds won gets credited with 1 game win. Shown in the lobby and voting screens.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `npm: command not found` | Node.js is not installed. See Step 1 in First-Time Setup. |
| `git: command not found` | Git is not installed. See Step 2 in First-Time Setup. |
| `npm start` shows an error | Make sure you ran `npm install` first. Make sure you're in the `ice-breaker-games` folder. |
| Friends can't open the URL | Make sure your tunnel is still running (Terminal 2). The URL changes each session. |
| Page loads but shows "Connection: connecting" | The game server (Terminal 1) might have stopped. Check that `npm start` is still running. |
| "Room not found" error | Double-check the 4-character room code. It's case-insensitive. |
| "Game already in progress" | Players can only join during the lobby phase, before the host clicks Start. |
| Friend sees the page but can't connect | They might be using `localhost` instead of the tunnel URL. Share the tunnel URL (the `https://...` one). |
| localtunnel asks for a password | Visit the URL once, accept the warning page, then refresh. This is a localtunnel quirk. |
| ngrok shows "ERR_NGROK_8012" | Your ngrok authtoken is missing or expired. Re-run the `ngrok config add-authtoken` command. |

---

## Configuration

The server runs on port `3000` by default. To use a different port:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```
