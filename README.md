# Game Arena — Multiplayer Party Games

A collection of real-time multiplayer icebreaker games for up to 8 players. Host a room, share a link, vote on which game to play, and compete!

**Works on mobile** — players can join from phones or tablets. Snake supports swipe-to-move and on-screen arrow buttons. Sketch & Guess supports finger drawing. All other games are tap-friendly with large touch targets.

**Live at:** [ice-breaker-games-production.up.railway.app](https://ice-breaker-games-production.up.railway.app/)

**Included games:**
- **Snake Arena** — Classic multiplayer snake. Eat food, grow, outlast opponents.
- **Two Truths & a Lie** — One player writes three statements. Others guess which is the lie.
- **Emoji Storytelling** — Describe a movie/phrase using only emojis. Others guess the answer.
- **Sketch & Guess** — One player draws a secret word. Others type guesses in real time.
- **Speed Trivia** — Timed multiple-choice questions. Faster correct answers earn more points.

## TL;DR — Play Now (No Setup Required)

The game is already hosted online. Just share the link:

```
https://ice-breaker-games-production.up.railway.app/
```

- One person opens the link, clicks **Host Room**, and shares the 4-character room code
- Everyone else opens the same link, enters the code, and clicks **Join Room**
- Click **Start Games** when everyone's in — up to 8 players

**That's it.** No installs, no tunnel, no server to run.

## Hosting on Railway (Your Own Deployment)

If you want your own copy of the game hosted permanently online — with auto-deploy whenever you push code to GitHub — Railway is the recommended approach.

### What you get
- A permanent public URL (like `https://your-app.up.railway.app`) that always works
- Auto-deploys every time you push to your GitHub repo — no manual redeploys
- Free tier available (sufficient for small groups); no credit card required to start
- Nothing to run locally — Railway runs the server 24/7

### Step 1 — Create a Railway account

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **Login** → **Login with GitHub**
3. Authorise Railway to access your GitHub account

### Step 2 — Create a new project

1. In the Railway dashboard, click **New Project**
2. Select **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. Find and select `ice-breaker-games` (or your fork of it)
4. Railway will detect the project and start deploying automatically

### Step 3 — Set the start command

Railway needs to know how to run the server. In your project settings:

1. Click on the deployed service (the box that appears after connecting the repo)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Deploy** → **Start Command**
3. Enter: `node server/index.js`
4. Click **Save** — Railway will redeploy with the correct command

### Step 4 — Get your public URL

1. In the Railway project, click on your service
2. Go to **Settings** → **Networking** → **Generate Domain**
3. Railway gives you a URL like `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
4. That's your permanent link — share it with anyone to play

### Step 5 — Auto-deploy is already on

Every time you push code to the connected GitHub branch, Railway rebuilds and redeploys automatically. No extra steps needed.

### Notes on the free tier

- Railway's free tier includes 500 hours/month of runtime — enough for regular play sessions
- The server may "sleep" after a period of inactivity on the free tier; the first person to open the URL wakes it up (takes ~5 seconds)
- If you play frequently, consider upgrading to the Hobby plan ($5/month) for always-on uptime

## Running Locally (Development / Testing)

Use this if you're making changes to the code and want to test before pushing.

### First-Time Setup

You only need to do this once on your local machine.

**Step 1 — Install Node.js**

Node.js is the engine that runs the game server.

**macOS:**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the **LTS** version and run the installer
3. Verify in Terminal:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

**Windows:**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the **LTS** version, run the `.msi` installer with default settings
3. Verify in PowerShell:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

**Step 2 — Install Git**

**macOS:** Run `git --version` — if not installed, macOS will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools.

**Windows:** Download from [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install with defaults.

**Step 3 — Clone and install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmytrobondarenko-cloud/ice-breaker-games.git
cd ice-breaker-games
npm install
```

Run `npm install` from inside the `ice-breaker-games` folder. This takes 10–30 seconds and only needs to be done once.

### Running the server locally

```bash
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. Open multiple tabs to simulate multiple players.

To stop the server, press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal.

### Development mode (with hot-reload)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Game server
npm run server

# Terminal 2 — Vite dev server with hot-reload
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. Changes to `src/` files reload instantly.

## Playing Over the Same Wi-Fi (LAN)

If everyone is in the same room or on the same network, you can run locally and share your local IP — no internet required.

### 1. Start the server

```bash
cd ice-breaker-games
npm start
```

### 2. Find your local IP

**macOS:**
```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
ipconfig | findstr /i "IPv4"
```

This prints something like `192.168.1.42`.

### 3. Share the link

The link to share with friends on the same network:
```
http://192.168.1.42:3000
```
(swap in your actual IP)

Friends open that in their browser — no install needed. You open it too (don't use `localhost`, use the IP so everyone is on the same connection).

### 4. Host and play

- Click **Host Room** and share the 4-character code
- Friends enter the code and click **Join Room**
- Click **Start Games** when everyone's in

## Optional — Internet Play Without Railway (Cloudflare Tunnel)

If Railway isn't an option (e.g. company security policy blocks it), you can still host temporarily from your local machine using a free tunnel.

This requires your computer to be on while people are playing. The public URL changes every session.

**Install Cloudflare Tunnel (one time):**

macOS:
```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
winget install Cloudflare.cloudflared
```

Or download directly from [developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)

**Run it:**

```bash
# Terminal 1 — game server
npm start

# Terminal 2 — creates a public link
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

You'll see a URL like `https://some-random-words.trycloudflare.com` — share that with friends.

**When you're done playing:**
1. Press **Ctrl + C** in Terminal 2 to stop the tunnel (the public URL immediately stops working)
2. Press **Ctrl + C** in Terminal 1 to stop the game server

The tunnel doesn't install any background service and doesn't leave anything running — it's fully temporary.

> **No cloudflared?** As a fallback, run `npx localtunnel --port 3000` instead — no install or signup needed. You'll get a URL like `https://ugly-fish-42.loca.lt`. Note: localtunnel may show a warning page on first visit; click through it once and refresh.

## How to Play Each Game

### Snake Arena

**Controls:**
- **Desktop:** Arrow keys or WASD
- **Mobile:** Swipe on the board in any direction, or tap the on-screen arrow buttons

**How it works:** Each player controls a snake on a shared 30×30 grid. Your snake moves forward continuously — you can only change direction. Eat the red food pellets to grow longer and score points. If your snake hits a wall, another snake, or its own body, you die. Solo play is fully supported — the game only ends when your snake actually dies.

**Scoring:** +1 point per food pellet eaten.

**Winning a round:** The last snake alive wins the round. If all snakes die simultaneously, the one with the highest score wins.

**Host controls:** After a round ends, the host clicks **Next Round** to start a fresh snake game, or **End Game** to return to voting.

---

### Two Truths & a Lie

**How it works:** Players take turns as the presenter. The presenter writes three statements about themselves — two true and one lie — then marks which one is the lie. They have **60 seconds** to submit. The other players then have **30 seconds** to vote on which statement they think is the lie.

**Scoring:**
- If you correctly identify the lie → **+1 point** for you
- If you're fooled (pick a truth) → **+1 point** for the presenter

**Winning a round:** The player who gained the most points in that round wins.

**Timers:** 60s to write statements, 30s to vote. The host can click **Skip** to force-advance.

---

### Emoji Storytelling

**How it works:** Players take turns as the storyteller. The storyteller is given a movie, TV show, event, or phrase and must describe it using **only emojis** — picked from the built-in emoji picker (8 categories: People, Activities, Animals, Food, Travel, Nature, Objects, Symbols). The picker includes body-part emojis like 🦶👣🦵 so you can represent things like "Cold Feet". Once submitted, all other players type text guesses.

**Scoring:**
- 1st correct guesser → **4 points**
- 2nd correct guesser → **3 points**
- 3rd correct guesser → **2 points**
- 4th+ correct guesser → **1 point**
- The storyteller gets **+1 point** for each player who guesses correctly

**Winning a round:** The first player to guess correctly wins the round.

**Timer:** The storyteller has **45 seconds** to pick and submit emojis. If time runs out, the round is automatically skipped. Once emojis are submitted, guessing is untimed. The host can click **Skip** to move on early.

---

### Sketch & Guess

**How it works:** Players take turns as the drawer. The drawer sees a secret word and draws it on a canvas using their mouse, trackpad, or finger (touch screens fully supported). Colour options (black, blue, red, yellow, green) and a clear button are available. Other players see the drawing in real time and type guesses while the drawer is still drawing.

**Scoring:** Same as Emoji Storytelling:
- 1st correct guesser → **4 points**
- 2nd correct guesser → **3 points**
- 3rd correct guesser → **2 points**
- 4th+ correct guesser → **1 point**
- The drawer gets **+1 point** per correct guesser

**Winning a round:** The first player to guess correctly wins the round.

**Timer:** The drawer has **45 seconds**. When it runs out, the word is revealed and the next round starts. The host can also click **Skip**.

---

### Speed Trivia

**How it works:** Timed multiple-choice questions are shown to all players simultaneously. Each question has 4 options and a **15-second countdown**. Click your answer — the faster you answer correctly, the more points you earn. After each question, the correct answer is highlighted for 5 seconds. A set of 10 questions forms one round.

**Scoring:** Points per correct answer depend on speed:
- Answer instantly → **up to 1,000 points**
- Answer at the last second → **100 points** (minimum for a correct answer)
- Wrong answer → **0 points**

Formula: `points = ceil((time_remaining / 15) × 1000)`, minimum 100.

**Winning a round:** The player with the highest score across 10 questions wins the round. After 10 questions, the host presses **Start Next Set** to begin a fresh set — it won't auto-start.

**No host skip** — trivia is fully automated with its own timers.

---

## Host Controls & Leaderboards

**Host controls (available to the room creator):**
- **Start Games** — begins the first voting round from the lobby
- **End Game** — ends the current game, awards a game win to the leading player, and returns to voting
- **Next Round** (Snake only) — starts a new snake round after one ends
- **Skip** (Truths, Emoji, Sketch) — force-advances a stuck phase
- **Start Next Set** (Trivia only) — begins the next 10-question set after a round completes

**Two-tier leaderboard:**
- **Rounds Won** (shown during each game) — tracks how many rounds each player has won within the current game session
- **Games Won** (shown in lobby and voting screens) — when the host clicks **End Game**, the player with the most rounds won is credited with **1 game win**; this persists across all games in the session

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `npm: command not found` | Node.js is not installed. See First-Time Setup above. |
| `git: command not found` | Git is not installed. See First-Time Setup above. |
| `npm start` shows an error | Make sure you ran `npm install` first and you're in the `ice-breaker-games` folder. |
| Railway URL doesn't load | Railway may be waking up the server — wait 5–10 seconds and refresh. |
| Friends can't open the tunnel URL | Make sure your tunnel terminal is still running. The URL changes each session. |
| Page loads but shows "Connection: connecting" | The game server may have stopped. Check that `npm start` is still running. |
| "Room not found" error | Double-check the 4-character room code. It's case-insensitive. |
| "Game already in progress" | Players can only join during the lobby phase, before the host clicks Start. |
| Friend sees the page but can't connect | They might be using `localhost` instead of the shared URL. |
| localtunnel shows a warning page | Click through it once and refresh — this is a localtunnel quirk. |
| `cloudflared: command not found` | Install it: `brew install cloudflared` (macOS) or `winget install Cloudflare.cloudflared` (Windows). |

## Configuration

The server runs on port `3000` by default. To use a different port:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```
